I want to share an insight on the topic of why computer science? Why programming? Even in the age of AI replacing software engineers, why learn computer science? Why, if there won't be any software engineering jobs in five years, would I still choose to study JavaScript and HTML and CSS and programming?

My answer to you is this: **true, raw, unrestrained, unbridled creativity in the 21st century can only truly arise from a deep, bedrock, fundamental understanding of computer science**.

Let me say it again, slightly differently. In the 21st century, true, raw, unrestrained, unbridled creativity can only be sourced from a deep, bedrock understanding and experience in computer science.

## Innovation and the Future of Computing

Think about innovation. The kettle, a kitchen appliance the world owns. Someone made it. The same goes for a toaster. Now, consider silicon - who was the first person to make a silicon chip?

Now, let's bring this idea down from the clouds and tie it to the floor. The future of spatial computing, mixed reality, virtual reality, augmented reality - whatever you want to call it - allows for a plethora of profound, incredible technologies and experiences that we've yet to comprehend. We're not visionary enough, we don't use it, and it's not globally widespread.

## The Evolution of Experience Capture

Take photos, for example. Photos are an attempt to hold onto memory. It's a snapshot, a way to freeze an experience you're having in the present moment. You capture it in pixels so you can reflect on it later, holding onto it as evidence, as an eternal memory. It's a metaphysical phenomenon, really - photographs and videos.

The evolution of this might be the ability to capture one's sensory experiences in the present moment with perfect precision. Imagine being able to not only relive that experience but share it with others - for entertainment, spirituality, or as evidence in matters of crime and justice.

This technology can only be facilitated with virtual reality and spatial computing, due to the physical limitations of human beings. And this brings us full circle to my original point: true innovation and genuine creativity in the 21st century will be found in computer science.

## AI and the Changing Landscape of Programming

Now, AI is changing a lot of this. It's bridging the gap where English is becoming a programming language, and programming as we know it is disappearing. We can have AI agents acting as software engineers for us.

But our ability to communicate with them and achieve true sophistication, finesse, and nuance would come from being able to play tango with it as well as it can play tango with you. That's still my perspective, and I don't really know how that would change.

## The Path to Financial Freedom

If you really want to build something that can pull you out of wage slavery, out of your dependence on money from others to barely survive, if you want to uplift yourself into an entirely new way of living - where you can purchase beautiful properties across the planet on a whim - then getting really good and really passionate about advanced computer science concepts, and perhaps mathematics and physics as well, is going to position you best for that raw luck and possibility.

## The World of AGI

What happens to the world if AGI can do anything a human can do, but better? What happens when computers can completely replace doctors, lawyers, software engineers, programmers, cybersecurity developers, game developers, musicians, and more?

It creates a space where the winners, the 1% who will reap the benefits of those technologies, are:
- The most well-spoken
- The most effective communicators
- The most determined, relentless, extremely passionate, intelligent, committed individuals who dare to decide they want a different life
- The people who create for creativity itself
- Those who advance their mind and intellect
- Those who hone their ability to create something from nothing using their imagination
- The true stoics who understand what's in their control and what isn't
- Those who have developed their skill set in understanding and leveraging technologies that eliminate reliance on others to create profound things

These people will change the world and reap the lion's share of all the abundance to come in the next hundred years.

I choose to spend the rest of my life working to be that person. I hope you do to.
